# GovAlta/ui-components - Component statistics Documentation (Spike)


## Introduction 
Currently, our team has no view into where, how, or how many of our components are being used in DDI products. This creates a large Blindspot and makes informed decision-making quite difficult. This information would be very valuable because it would allow us to focus our efforts in high-impact areas.

We currently use the following tools to gather data:
- Github

## Investigation documentation 
Target:

Explore the following options for tracking component usage:

- Run script on a product teams GitHub repo that identifies all instances of our components

- Install tracking components in a product team repo that sends data back to the design system team (need to connect with Application & Product security folks to figure out how to do this without violating policy).

- Other options?

Data we would want to capture and report on

- Which components are being used?

    - React

    - Angular

    - Web components

- Are the product templates in use?

- What version of the libraries are in use? (Also want to check for old versions of libraries here)

    - React

    - Angular

    - Vue

- How many of each component are being used?

- Design token usage

**_**More experimental (nice to have) data**_**

- What percentage of our components make up the total component usage for a product?

- Rate of adoption change over time for all DS assets. (e.g. included 40 component instances last month and 85 this month)

  - Month over month

  - Quarter over quarter

  - etc.

Which component properties are being used for each component
